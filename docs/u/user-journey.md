#### Define

**An outline of the overall scenario and subsequent steps a user will take while Interacting with a product or service**

Designers create user journeys to explore how users currently (or potentially) interact with a product, service or website. Informing UX strategy and design, they are usually made during the requirements gathering phase of a project.

User journeys are beneficial for a few reasons. Firstly, they help communicate the project's vision - showing stakeholders what the work could achieve for users. Secondly, analyzing current user behaviour and needs helps designers map out required features and functions easily. Thirdly, they help designers formulate the information architecture and interface design required to deliver the steps users typically take.

A user journey should be produced for each persona. Each one will tell a unique story from that user's perspective and help designers meet their overall needs.

The layout, complexity and content of user journeys will depend on the project and product. But common elements include:

* Persona characteristics
* Journey phases
* Triggers
* Channels
* Context of use
* User touch points
* User activity & interactions
* User thoughts, feelings and emotions
* System actions
