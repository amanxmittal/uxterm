#### Define

**An approach to design where user needs and desires are primary concerns**

While user experience (UX) is an overarching title, User-Centred Design (UCD) is a design process and methodology where the user and the user's experience are pivotal to the whole project. The core elements of UCD are visibility, accessibility, legibility, and language when designing a system, app or website.

UCD was originally conceived by Donald Norman in his book Design of Everyday Things in 1986. He suggested that design should be based on the needs of the user, and slightly de-emphasized aesthetic concerns. When UCD is used in the most pure form, project stakeholders and target users are consulted via testing prototypes to identify issues early.
