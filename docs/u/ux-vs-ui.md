#### Define

**UX refers to the whole User Experience, whereas User Interface (VI) is one element ot this experience** 

User Experience (UX) is how users think and feel when interacting with a website or product. UX designers aim to improve customer satisfaction by enhancing the value, ease of use and pleasure experienced during these interactions.

User Interface (IJI) refers to the physical and technical ways that users interact with websites or products (e.g. clicking on a button). IJI designers visually guide users through an interface, defining how elements look, work, where they are placed and how easy it is to understand them. Being at the front line of how users interact with many businesses IJI is one of the most important tools of UX.

Some argue that UX and Ul are synonymous as the output of UX is often manifested in the user interface. Most, however, agree that this overlooks the strategic nature of UX - utilizing research and user testing to ensure you build things that people actually want, need and will use.
