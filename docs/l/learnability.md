#### Define

**Refers to the ease with which the use of a product can be picked up and understood by users.**

Learnability describes a platform's capability to help users become familiar with the functionality easily and quickly. If a product, website, app or software has high learnability, the amount of time (or training) a person needs to become familiar with the system is reduced. It's vital for the success of a platform!

Considering learnability encourages designers to seek a balance between designing for first time users and experts. Intelligent design can ensure first time users get up to speed easily and quickly without hindering expert (or power) users who demand more from a product or service.

Ways to improve learnability include understanding how users expect similar products to work. Aim to provide functionality that match users' expectations, unless a different approach is found to be more intuitive. Usability testing is the key to proving great learnability in a product, as designers can see how users will interact with their product. That's why usability is closely linked to learnability.

Progressive disclosure is another technique that's valuable for increasing learnability. Making products look simple to use helps to establish a good initial perception. De-cluttering the user interface is one way to achieve this For example, showing users a selection of the most important options they might need, with specialised features for advanced users easily obtainable on request.
