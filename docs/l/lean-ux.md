#### Define

**A design practice which focuses on the end-goal and the elimination of unnecessary tasks**

Lean UX is inspired by lean and agile development theories. It places greater focus on the actual experience being designed, and less on the deliverables.

With this approach, traditional documents are stripped down to their bare components to provide the minimum amount of information necessary for very short, iterative, design cycles.

A key element is feedback â€” early and often - both from the development team and users.

Lean UX requires input from the whole team to ensure success, rather than relying on a solitary designer working to a specification.
