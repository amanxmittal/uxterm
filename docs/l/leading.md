#### Define

**The space between each line of text**

Also known as line height or line spacing, leading can improve the readability of text and create a vertical rhythm. The term is derived from hand-typesetting, where strips of lead were used to create space between each line of text.

Increasing or decreasing the spacing between lines of a block of text can alter readability. Reducing leading places lines closely together, which can make text hard to read. Users' reading flow is disrupted, as finding the next line is difficult. Increasing the leading can stop this issue, improving readability, Too much leading can cause the opposite effect. Lines of text appear disconnected, and use space less efficiently.

Leading is also used to create vertical rhythm on pages. Techniques include maintaining consistent spaces between different elements and repeating patterns, like a list of news articles. This allows the page to appear organised, balanced and easier to read as a whole.
