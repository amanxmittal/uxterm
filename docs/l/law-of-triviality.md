#### Define

**This principle refers to situations where trivial issues are given too much weight over more substantial ones**

This principle states that the amount of discussion around an issue is often inversely proportional to its complexity.

C. N. Parkinson was the first person to distill this principle. It's best explained by using the example of fictional committees who preferred spending more time discussing the refreshments or color of the bike shed, than considering the build of a nuclear reactor. This phenomenon is also known as the 'bike-shed effect' or 'bike- shedding' after the metaphor became popular in the 90s.

There are several principle happens:

* People can find it easier to focus on smaller problems than what's most significant. The consequences Of wrong decisions for trivial issues would have a smaller impact than bigger, complex problems.
* Trivial issues are likely to engage more people in discussion. Everyone can relate to something they see and experience every day, so more people are likely to feel knowledgeable enough to share opinions. Naturally, this can end up creating very long debates.
* A problem can be so simple that it puts extra stress on people. There are no logical criteria that can help make every decision. As they often come down to subjective elements, this can make people feel less confident. As a consequence, people spend more time considering than necessary, feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information to process.

This principle is useful to consider so the most important issues and ideas are prioritised, either during group discussions or considering issues alone. Suggestions for how to avoid this situation include:

* Asking how significant the task is, and how much impact it will have on the bigger picture.
* If a decision does not have a big impact in the long term, it may be necessary to opt for one of the options and stop worrying about the others.
* Sometimes there is no need to involve too many people in a discussion. Also, it's good practice to ask for others' opinions only when you are ready for the feedback.
