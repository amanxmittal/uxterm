#### Define

**Related, but often confused, concepts which affect the user's ability to consume text content**

Legibility concerns the recognition of text: the ease of identifying the shapes of characters and words. If the user can recognise text consistently, without strain or difficulty, it is legible, Many factors can influence legibility, for example the size of the type, and the contrast or the choice of font. Words that use a font regarded as legible can still be unreadable if the setting or the placement is poor. At the same time more controversial fonts can be made more legible by considering the layout.

Readability concerns the content behind the text: the words chosen and the concepts discussed, and how easily those are understood.
