#### Define

**The opportune moment when users are most susceptible to relevant, persuasive messages.**

Kairos is an Ancient Greek word that translates as the supreme moment', originally referring to persuasive in rhetoric. It's a key persuasive technique. Considering Kairos is essential to boost appeal with audiences exactly when they are most likely to be persuaded, or when the content is most useful to them.

In UX design, applying Kairos effectively means considering the context in which a message or opportunity will be presented to the user. That's combined with analysis of when the user is mos likely to engage with it. For example, museum visitors are encouraged to 'exit through the gift shop' as they're more likely to purchase items after they have appreciated the exhibition. Similarly, there's a better chance digital users will engage with content if it's presented to them at a relevant and beneficial point in their journey. It's where their attention and interest peaks.

Considering the timing and context of information from the user's perspective is an essential element of creating effective user journeys that lead to successful outcomes. Understanding patterns of user behaviour is vital. Determining at what point in their journey, day or even lifetime that a user's choice is made can be valuable in UX design, favouring those decisive. influential moments through Kairos.
