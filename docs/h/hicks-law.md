#### Define

**The time taken to make a decision increases as the number of options Increases**

Hick's Law is also known as the 'Hick-Hyman Law'. In situations where a decision is made between multiple equal options, the time taken is related to the number of options available. A decision between few options will take less time than a decision between many options.

In interface design, this principle is often quoted to argue for the elimination of distractions and a reduction in the number of options presented to the user. It is especially relevant for tasks where time is an issue.

Hick's Law does **not** apply when:

* Options are spread between layers in a complex hierarchy
* Options are presented on unequal terms
* The user is highly familiar with the options available
* Significant reading is required to understand each option
