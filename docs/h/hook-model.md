#### Define

**A four-phase process that companies use to design habit-forming products and services**

Nir Eyal defined the Hook Model as a process where users become 'addicted' to a product or service. The model builds upon BJ Fogg's Behavioural Model (Behaviour = Motivation + Ability + Trigger).

The hook has four sequential stages that if repeated can generate unprompted, repeat user engagement. These four stages are :

* **Trigger** - that cues the user's action. Initially external triggers (e.g. an alert) are required. After going through the hook repeatedly, internal triggers, often negative emotions (e.g. fear or anxiety), suffice to engage the user as the behaviour has become habit (e.g. Tweeting when bored).
* **Action** - is the behaviour done in anticipation of reward (e.g. receiving a 'Like'). Actions require triggers and their likelihood depends on the user's motivation and how easy the action is.
* **Variable Rewards** - are required to form habits. Anticipation of unpredictable rewards is highly motivating, and activates brain areas associated with desire.
* **Investment** - is what the user puts into the product to improve it for their next use (e.g. inviting friends, subscribing). Investments make triggers more engaging, actions easier, and rewards more exciting, so habits are more likely to form.
