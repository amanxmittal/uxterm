#### Define

**The use of elements from an older design in a place where they are no longer necessary**

Skeuomorphic design makes use of elements from a previous form of an object, when those elements are no longer needed. Examples can be found in designs of all kinds. In digital design the term typically refers to a resemblance to real world objects.

On-screen examples include tabs that behave like tabbed folders, a button which appears to have depth, or a page-turning movement in an eBook. Skeuomorphs can also be audible, like the sound of a shutter on a digital camera which has no shutter.

Critics of skeuomorphism say it creates forced metaphors, relics on nostalgic elements (e.g. address books) that are foreign to younger users, and can hinder creation of more useful designs that aren't constrained by the physical world or previous designs.

Advocates say the approach can help users understand new technologies by using shared cultural understanding to quickly convey the purpose of an object.
