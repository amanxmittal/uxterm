#### Define

**A hierarchical diagram which defines the number, nature, and structure of pages (or views) In a website or application**

Typically created during the early phases of a project, this document defines the pages or views which make up a website or application, how they are related, and how content and functionality will be distributed between them. This will then be used as the basis for further development, for example wireframing.

For websites or applications which are rich in information (and so probably comprised of many pages) it is important to ensure the structure is compatible with the mental models of their users.

Note that this planning document is separate and distinct from the sitemap web page used to users navigate a website, or the XML document intended to allow search engines to index it.
