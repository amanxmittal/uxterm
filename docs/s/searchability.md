#### Define

**If an item has high searchability, users can easily locate information from an unknown location, either Internally or externally**

Searchability refers to how easy it is for a user to pinpoint information in an unknown location. Users input the information they do know, such as a specific word or phrase, in an attempt to locate more information about a topic. A highly searchable item will then rank highly among the results.

For instance, if you type a phrase into Google, it will supply you with all results pertaining to that phrase. The lower down the results list you go. the lower the searchability of the items shown.

Searchable websites feature strong accessibility and well-written content that is user focused in all respects. They are made searchable through meta tags, strategic keyword placement, and links to related and relevant content.

However, a searchable site isn't only searchable on search engines. Users may also look for content internally, so linking content together via a logical information architecture and using strategic keywords is of the utmost importance.
