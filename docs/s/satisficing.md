#### Define

**In decision-making, this term indicates when the option that is 'good enough' is chosen over a better path, which require more time or effort to discover.**

In most cases, users will look for the quickest solution to their problem, even if it isn't the ideal one. They do this by subconsciously weighing the importance of their query against the time taken to find the answer. The quickest solution that will suffice is often favoured over the optimum solution which would take longer to conceive or achieve.

So, the concept Of satisficing suggests a tendency in human decision-making to exert the minimal effort. The term was first coined by psychologist Herbert A. Simon in 1956 as a mixture Of the words 'satisfy' and 'suffice'. Users consider their time as precious. This should be closely considered in a user-centred design process.

For example, don't presume users are prepared to take additional steps to reach their goal. By providing easy steps for users to follow, the likelihood of them continuing their journey to find what they need increases. Presenting clear options at a glance that meet users' needs is often more effective than designing detailed, elaborate interfaces. Consider satisficing by ensuring users realise what they can gain from a website, before exhausting the time they will spend searching for it. Simple and effective, over advanced and impressive.
