#### Define

**A sample of fonts, colors and interface elements, deliberately separate from page layout, used to explore graphic design options**

Somewhat like a textile swatch, a style tile is a small sample of a proposed graphic design direction. Wireframes are used to explore page layout separate from visual design, so style tiles are used to explore visual design separate from layout, helping stakeholders to focus their feedback only on the visuals.

Another similarity style tiles share with wireframes is their simplicity and low fidelity, allowing multiple directions to be pursued and iterated on rapidly, at the same time, before settling on one to develop further.
