#### Define

**Recognising familiar things is easier than recalling them from memory**

Recognition memory is simply the realisation that something has been experienced before. It is easier to develop than recall memory, and it lasts longer. Recall memory is the retrieval of events or information from the past. It is slower, and harder to develop and maintain.

Stimulating recognition memory is more effective than expecting users to recall things unaided, For example, it's easier to choose the correct answer from a list of possible answers than it is to remember the correct answer outright. The list of answers narrows the number of possibilities that need to be considered, and provides cues which help us to pinpoint the correct memories.

Furthermore, a familiar option is often preferable to an unfamiliar option. Simply recognising one of the available options is often enough reason for users to choose it.

Make options clearly visible and available to aid recognition memory. Don't rely on users to recall essential information without help.
