#### Define

**Encouraging users to carry out an action by offering an incentive**

In many situations we pay back what we receive from others. This social convention is widely used in user-interface design, giving users something for free before asking them to carry out an action.
 For example, a user may be willing to provide their contact details in exchange for a free research paper on a topic they are interested in.

The balance of the value of the offer and the effort required of the user should be carefully considered.
