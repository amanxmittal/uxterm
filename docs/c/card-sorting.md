#### Define

**A low-tech collaborative exercise used to categorise objects, plan workflows, or define system structure**

This technique is often used to generate or evaluate website navigation, categorisation structures (i.e. taxonomies) and user journeys. It can be utilised on projects of any scale, from high-level structure to page- level prioritization of content.

First, content or functionality is broken down into the smallest appropriate units and listed on Post-lt notes or index cards. Related units are grouped together and these categories are given titles to build hierarchies. Categories and units are ordered to demonstrate routes through the system. Elements can easily be added, removed and rearranged until the optimal structure is found, at which point the result can be recorded with photography for later digitization or further work.

Due to its simplicity, a single facilitator can guide an inexperienced group with no knowledge of the technique. The inclusion of clients, users and domain experts allows everyone to contribute and builds a sense of shared effort and involvement.
