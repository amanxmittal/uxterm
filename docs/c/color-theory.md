#### Define

**A collection of guidelines and laws used to evoke emotion, set moods, and manage user attention through the application of color**

Color theory is a collection of laws, guidelines, and interpretations which guide the selection and use of colors. In user experience design, the meanings associated with certain colors and color groups is particularly significant.

There are two broad color groups: warm and cool. Warm colors (e.g. red, orange, and yellow) convey happiness, enthusiasm and positivity. Cool colors (e.g. green, blue, and purple) can be used to create calming and relaxing environments.

Individual colors also have their own meanings. Red can be used to convey importance or danger; error messages and delete buttons are commonly red to make the user aware of this. Green can be used to reassure the user; success messages and primary buttons make good use of this color to tell the user that everything is fine or that they are safe to proceed.

Beyond concerns of clarity and visual appeal, designers can consider the perceived meaning of the colors they use to strengthen the messages they are trying to deliver.
