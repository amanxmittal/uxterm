#### Define

**The planning, creation, and management of content**

Content strategy is a collective term for many tasks related to the management of a set of content for a website or similar system, particularly with regards to creation, delivery, and maintenance.

It is the role Of a content strategist to ensure each piece of content is delivered in the most appropriate form (be it text, video, image, or other media) and that it is findable, readable, understandable, actionable, and shareable.

Though content strategy is related to information architecture, the latter is more concerned with categorisation and labelling of content.
