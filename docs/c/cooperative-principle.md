#### Define

**Making the required contribution, at the appropriate time, as part of a normal exchange of information**

Good communication boosts the design process through four considerations: quality, quantity, relation, and manner.

In practice, this means being open and truthful, only using the appropriate level of information, being relevant and orderly, and avoiding ambiguity and jargon. These are key ways to have an effective conversation, whether in person or as part of a design.

The Cooperative Principle is particularly relevant to the design of forms.
