#### Define

**Different approaches used to deliver mobile apps**

When creating an app a number of different approaches can be used:

1. Native Apps Are installed through an app store and accessed via icons on the home screen. They are developed for a specific platform only (e.g. iOS or Android) and can take advantage of most of the device features (e.g. camera, contacts), incorporate gestures, use the device's notification system and work offline.

2. Web Apps Are mobile- optimised webpages that look and sometimes behave like an app. They are accessed via a browser like any other web page. Web Apps are built in cross-platform web languages that enable some native-like functionality to be obtained in the browser, and work across all mobile platforms.

3. Hybrid apps Are web apps wrapped in a native apps to allow access to all device features and produce a better user experience. Like native apps, they are installed from an app store. 

Each type of app has pros and cons, so the choice depends on your objectives and audience needs.
