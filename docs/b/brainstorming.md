#### Define

**A technique to generate spontaneous ideas around a specific problem**

This popular technique for  generating ideas by association  often uses groups of people, but is  also suitable for individuals.  

There are several key principles  that apply to both groups and  individuals. By focusing on the  quantity of ideas and not criticizing  each one, there is a greater chance  of finding a radical, effective  solution. Unusual or 'off the wall'  ideas are also welcomed, and good  ideas can be combined to create a  new approach to a design  challenge.
