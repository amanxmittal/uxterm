#### Define

**The framework of a design without textures, colours, typography or graphics**

A typical wireframe defines the overall layout, key elements and navigation of a design. It shows what goes where, providing a visual overview Of how everything is organised and interlinked.

Wireframes are particularly useful in helping to arrange design elements in the best way, making sure that the original reason to develop a site can be achieved within the creative and other design parameters.

They come in many forms - anything from a simple pencil drawing to a detailed software-generated overview. What they typically have in common is their focus on functionality, behaviour and priority of content, taking into account any user research.
