#### Define

**Disposable interface mock-ups, sketched on paper for quick iteration and experimentation**

Website design in its most crude form, this exercise encourages designers and stakeholders to sketch interface concepts on paper to experiment quickly and efficiently. By working roughly with paper and pen, ideas can be tested and discarded before creators become attached to their work. Crucially, a great deal of progress can be made without spending time on detailed functional prototypes.

Paper prototyping can be an effective kick off exercise with clients, helping to surface requirements and expectations, and share vision for the project. Prototyping can be carried out as a group exercise, or participants can create sketches individually followed by group discussion to combine concepts for further exploration. The results of these sessions are useful reference points to take forward into wireframes or prototypes.
