#### Define

**Including the widest range of stakeholders throughout the design process**

This approach to the design process directly involves stakeholders, from project leaders to end users, anywhere from requirement gathering through to the appraisal of proposed solutions. By integrating these people into the process, designers can identify true needs and verify that solutions truly meet those needs.

Quick, low-fidelity exercises like card sorting and paper prototyping are often used in participatory design to start conversations and draw out useful knowledge.
