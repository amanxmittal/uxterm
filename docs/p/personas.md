**Example characters who represent the user groups of a site, brand, or product**

Personas are created to better understand the goals, desires, and limitations of each key groups of users or stakeholders for a design. As part of a user-centred design, personas are useful in making design decisions, defining features, and refining interactions.

Personas are typically created from data collected from user interviews. This data can include user behaviour, aims. ambitions, abilities, and environment. Developers often use additional details to create a well-rounded character. More than one persona is usually created for each product or design to represent the key groups, but only the most relevant persona should be the primary focus.
