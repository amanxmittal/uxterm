#### Define

**This encourages developers, designers and system engineers to consider the privacy ot personal data throughout the design process**

Privacy by design focuses on the prioritisation of data protection controls from the outset of the design process, as opposed to leaving them as an afterthought. It enshrines privacy enhancing techniques, such as encryption or de-identification, that aim to decrease the identifiability of personal data. Likewise, it may also include measures that increase the user's control of their personal data, including granular consent mechanisms and privacy notices with high readability.

With the advent of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy by design principles will be legally required in some areas. However, it is generally good practice to encourage good practice in privacy by design in all sectors, as the UK's Information Commissioner's Office recommends.

These measures aim to minimise the risk of data breaches by maximising the protection of personal data.
