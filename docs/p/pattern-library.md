#### Define

**A collection of user interface (UI) design patterns**

Design patterns provide standard, effective reference points. From the libraries, designers can build the elements required for common user interactions, as well as create solutions to usability problems.

There are many different types of pattern libraries, which focus on different aspects of website or app design. These include navigation, gathering data, social media, user onboarding, typography and alerts. Specific examples of design patterns include calendar pickers, form input fields, search bars and social icons, These design patterns are generally tailored to match a company's visual design, as well as their website's specific usability needs.

In large organisations where multiple disparate teams are working on a website, pattern libraries are an essential way to maintain consistency throughout. Applying a pattern library also means elements can be reused and updated centrally, thus reducing design and development time.
