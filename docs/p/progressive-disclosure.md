#### Define

**A method for reducing complexity by showing only necessary or requested Information**

A technique for handling complex or feature-rich designs. By keeping the initial design simple and revealing less important information in stages, complexity can be reduced.

In interface design, a common application of progressive disclosure is to show the most frequently used features at the top level, and hide seldom used features in another layer, e.g. in a submenu. In this way, key features are noticeable and easily accessible, as infrequently used options are not a distraction.

The prioritisation of information should be carefully researched and verified to ensure it meets user needs and expectations. Once prioritised, the 80/20 rule can be used to determine what should be shown and what should be hidden.
