#### Define

**A reusable solution to a frequently recurring design problem**

While working on a project, many encounter identical (or comparable) user experience problems that have already been 'solved'. These solutions are called design patterns. In most cases, they can be applied to solve issues quickly and effectively.

As design patterns are applied widely across the web, users have become familiar with (and even expect) them. Design patterns can help users quickly adapt to an interface. Users can interact without much thought, from using a similar interface to complete the same task elsewhere.

It's important to note that design patterns are not a one- size-fits-all solution. They may need to be tailored to fit the user interface and user experience of specific projects. Examples of design patterns include:

* Navigational breadcrumbs
* Pagination
* Using five stars for ratings
* Dragging and dropping elements into the interface, or within it

Common responses that achieve the opposite (negative!) effect are named anti-patterns.
