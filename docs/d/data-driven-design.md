#### Define

**The practice of creating a design In which every decision Is driven by empirical findings on user preferences, goals and behaviours**

Because they are invested in the success of a project, even the most experienced designers cannot reliably predict what users want. Data- driven design techniques are used to remedy this issue. Unlike other design methods where the designer uses their intuition to make decisions, data-driven designs are steered entirely by empirical findings regarding user preferences, goals and behaviours.

Surveys, analytics and consumer research are all employed to see what design features perform well among users, instead of relying on the designer's intuition. Those features that don't perform well are discarded or altered in favour of more appealing ones.

There are various techniques designers can use to test their builds on users, including A/B testing. It's also worth noting that the data designers collect can vary: it can be quantitative or qualitative, and collected on a large or small scale.
