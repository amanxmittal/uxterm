#### Define

**Adapting web pages for the capabilities of the device or browser used to view them**

The term Adaptive Web Design (AWD) was coined by Aaron Gustafson to describe a way of optimising web pages for the device or browser used to view them. Beginning with principles of progressive enhancement, AWD seeks to create an appropriate experience for users no matter what device or platform they Use.

AWD uses techniques such as responsive web design (RWD) and feature detection to deliver an optimised version of the site. Though visuals will change, ideally functionality will be similar, and content should be consistent everywhere.

Optimisations may include increasing the size of controls to make them touch-friendly, integrating functionality like telephone calls or camera use when compatible hardware is detected, or sending smaller images to devices on slower internet connections
