#### Define

**A common response to a repeated issue, which can be ineffective**

Coined by Andrew Koenig in 1995. anti-patterns are the ineffective opposite of reliable design patterns. Two factors that must be present to define the common response (or solution) as an anti- pattern, rather than a bad idea or habit.

These are:

* The course Of action appears helpful initially, but typically generates more negative outcomes than positive
* There is another solution that has been documented and validated as more effective

Anti-patterns can occur from lack of knowledge (or experience) with solving a problem, or little awareness of other solutions. Others are caused by applying a good design pattern to an incompatible issue.

Common anti-patterns include:

* Bicycle shed: reassigning resources to solve trivial issues
* Bleeding edge: using new technologies that are not proven, which cause cost performance issues, and/or delays
* Design by committee: involving too many contributors in a design process, without a unifying vision
* Scope creep: unregulated changes or adding new features to a project, after the original key requirements have been agreed
