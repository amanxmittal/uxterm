#### Define

**Guiding users through a sequence of activities, step by step, to encourage certain behaviours**

B.J. Fogg coined the term tunnelling as one of his seven tools of persuasion. Tunnelling, also known as Guided Persuasion, is when you lead users through a Of preâ€”defined steps.

All navigation, content and functionality that could distract the user are eliminated, decreasing the user motivation required to complete a task and increasing the likelihood of task completion. For example, software installation wizards typically apply tunnelling techniques.

Tunnelling makes it easier for users to go through a process as the interface directs them. It controls their experience, in order to encourage specific behaviours, without taking away their sense of control.

In addition to helping users to complete tasks, tunnelling can also persuade users by exposing them to things they otherwise may not see. For instance, throughout software installations users are captive audiences, so may be presented with promotions for supplementary products.
