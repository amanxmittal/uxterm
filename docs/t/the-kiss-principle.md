#### Define

**This principle states that simplicity should be a core aspect of any design, with complexity kept to a minimum**

KISS is shorthand for â‚¬Keep it simple. stupid'. a design principle that prioritizes simplicity over complexity in all aspects of a design. It originates from the U.S. Navy in the 1960s, and is most associated with the aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson. Johnson aimed to encourage simplicity in aircraft design, to the point that the average mechanic could repair a jet with minimal tools even under combat conditions.

Since Johnson first introduced his principle, KISS has been adopted across the engineering world, including software engineering and UX design. That's because the easier something is to understand and use, the greater chance it will catch on and users will engage with it. After all, if users can't understand a product it is unlikely to increase its market share, but one that is easier to understand will.

Importantly, the design must not be made so simple the user cannot complete their objective. If a complex design will enhance the user's experience it should be used, but complexity should be eradicated if it's presence is unnecessary.
