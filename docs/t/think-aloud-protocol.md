#### Define

**A method of gathering verbal data during usability testing**

This technique asks participants to verbally describe everything they do, think, see, and experience while they take part in a usability test. 

Researchers can observe first-hand how tasks are completed, rather than just seeing the end result. It is important that observers simply take objective notes of everything users say and do, without interpreting or influencing them in any way. Using audio and video recording allows researchers to gain understanding of how and why participants reacted in certain circumstances.

There are two main approaches: capturing what is recorded during the task, and what is recorded after it.

A slightly different method is the Talk-Aloud Protocol. Users only describe their actions, and do not offer an explanation. This can be more objective, as the users do not interpret their actions for the researcher, or justify their choices.
