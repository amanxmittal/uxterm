#### Define

**Motivation, ability and a successful trigger are all necessary, in a single moment, before an action will be carried out**

At its simplest, this model helps designers to identify what stops users from performing particular actions. Named for its developer BJ Fogg, it states that a lack of motivation, an inability to carry out the task, or the absence of a trigger can each be responsible. Each of the three elements has a collection of sub-components which can assist the designer in identifying the exact issue.

It is important to note that the model states all three elements must align simultaneously for the action to be taken.
