#### Define

**How easy It Is to find Information In an expected location**

Findability is about a user's ability to locate a specific piece of known information in an expected location. Users already know where to find the information, they are just trying to get there. If the location has high findability, users can reach it easily. This differs from searchability, where users are hunting for information in an unknown location.

There are two sides to findability: how easily a site is found through organic search and how easily content is found from within the site itself For a site and its content to have high findability, it needs to have a good user interface with a search bar, high accessibility and great SEO.

Good findability is also characterised by search term suggestions, term highlighting, and the ability to locate items even if search terms are spelt incorrectly.
