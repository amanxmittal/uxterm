#### Define

**As flexibility is increased, usability decreases**

Designers must compromise between the extremes of a completely flexible system and perfect usability. A completely flexible system, which could accommodate any task, would be infinitely complicated and so very difficult to use. A perfectly usable system, through removal of confusing or distracting elements and functions, would be incredibly simple, to the point where its usefulness would be very limited.

A good balance between flexibility and usability is dependent on the needs and expectations of the user. If the needs of the audience are clearly defined, specialised solutions that target those needs exactly will be more successful. If the needs of the audience are very broad or cannot be clearly defined, a flexible solution will be necessary.
