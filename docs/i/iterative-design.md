#### Define

**In a bid to improve quality and functionality, this approach involves a cyclic process ot prototyping, testing and refining a product**

Iterative design promotes the constant refinement of a product throughout the production process. At every stage of the design, the product is tested and analysed to ensure that it meets and exceeds user expectations. Any areas for improvement are identified and remedied before the product moves on to the next stage of development and a new iteration.

One of the biggest benefits to iterative design comes from having users interact with the various iterations. Researching and testing the iterations like this means you can identify unpredictable user needs and behaviours and design the next iteration to accommodate for those requirements.

This is a cost-effective approach to design because if you can recognise issues early on, it is easier to rectify them than during the final stages of the production process.
