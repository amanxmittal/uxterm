#### Define

**An experience including many touchpoints, with consistency and seamless movement between them**

Omni-channel UX is an approach seamless, integrated, consistent experience across all touchpoints, or "channels".

A consumer might move between many channels in the lead up to a purchase: researching the product online, visiting a shop to try it, using a mobile device to check competitor pricing, then buying over the phone. With an omni- channel approach to UX, the retailer would examine all of these channels, looking for opportunities to ease the transition between channels, and to make information and messaging consistent.

An ideal omni-channel experience will make the same information available on all channels (e.g. inventory, promotions, customer account information, and purchase history) and allow customers to pause their task on one channel, then resume it on another.

It is important to consider not only the experience of each channel, but also how they hand off to each other, and how they track and make use of customer's goals and details, to demonstrate continuity.
