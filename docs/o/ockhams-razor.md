#### Define

**When choosing between two equivalent options, the simplest should be selected**

Ockham's Razor is a principle which argues that simplicity should always be preferred to complexity. When choosing between two designs with the same function. the option which is simplest should be selected. It may also be described as choosing the option which makes fewer assumptions.

Like the 80/20 rule and signal-to- noise ratio, Ockham's Razor is often cited to argue for the removal of elements which are not immediately useful or relevant.
