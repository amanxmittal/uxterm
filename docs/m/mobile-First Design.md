#### Define

**The practice of designing for the smallest expected screen size, then enhancing on larger screen sizes**

Often, when a responsive web design (RWD) starts with a large screen, designers can run into difficulty trying to squeeze elements onto smaller screens in later stages. By starting with the smallest screen size and working upwards, reconfiguring the layout and enhancing features, this dilemma can be avoided.

This approach can also be applied to content, contextual features, and development (specifically in the structure of CSS media queries).
