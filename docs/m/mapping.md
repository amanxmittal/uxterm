#### Define

**The implied relationships between controls and their effects**

Mapping implies the nature of the relationship between a control and the effect it will have when interacted with. If the actual effect of the control matches what the user expected, then the control has good mapping.

For example, when a button for moving left in a series of images is aligned to the left of the current image, its placement implies how it will behave; it would be mapped well. If, on the other hand, the button was centred beneath the image, its placement would be ambiguous; it would not be mapped well.
