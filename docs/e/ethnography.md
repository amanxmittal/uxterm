#### Define

**A qualitative research method where behaviour Is observed In Its natural setting**

Ethnography is a practice that emphasizes the detailed observation of people in naturally occurring settings. It originated in anthropology, with researchers studying a culture by spending long periods of time within it.

In user Experience terms, ethnography is when researchers observe and/or interact with users in areas of their everyday lives. This contrasts with interview-based research which is usually more time limited, takes place outside the user's environment and is limited to a specific discussion format.

Ethnography enables researchers to go beyond demographics and gather rich data about users' lifestyles, attitudes, motivations and context that couldn't be achieved through other methods.
